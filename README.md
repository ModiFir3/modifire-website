I wanted to create a website for my viewers who view me across different platforms. Hopefully this will help grow all my platforms by providing the views with one place to find all my social platforms to follow. First I wanted to add a nav bar so that anyone who comes to the site can jump to where they want to go or know about. Within this Navbar and the main body of this website I will have three main sections about me which will highlight my journey, current objective,  and purpose. Next section will be the social platform to keep a minimalist look. The links will be the main vector/ image of the respected website that will take you to the homepage of the ModiFire’s respective platform. The images will be grayed out and when you hover over them it will be highlighted. At the top of the links section will be the banner that is used on all of modifire’s platforms and the colors in the banner will reflect the color pattern in this website. Lastly there will be contact information at the bottom. This will be there for business that wish to sponsor or get into contact with modifire for any business related deals. This website should also work to be on any device such as a smartphone or tablet.
